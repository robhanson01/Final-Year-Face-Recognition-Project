# Final-Year-Face-Recognition-Project

This page details my final year project on neural network based face recognition for autonomous vehicle navigation.

Contained in the repository are the final report, source code, testing results and demonstration of a deep neural network based face recognition system deployed on an autonomous vehicle using a Raspberry Pi and Intel Movidius NCS
